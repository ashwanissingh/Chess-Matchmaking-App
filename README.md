Real-Time Chess Clone
A real-time chess application inspired by Chess.com, built using Express.js, Chess.js, and Socket.IO for real-time gameplay scenarios. The project was created by learning through tutorials and documentation, gaining hands-on experience with server-side data handling and real-time communication.

Features
üéÆ Real-time multiplayer chess gameplay.
üïπÔ∏è Interactive user interface using EJS templates.
‚ö° Fast and efficient real-time updates using Socket.IO.
‚ôüÔ∏è Valid chess moves and game logic handled by Chess.js.
üìú Clean and modular code structure for better scalability.
Technologies Used
Languages:

JavaScript, Ejs
Frameworks & Libraries:

Express.js: Backend framework for server handling.
Socket.IO: Real-time communication between server and clients.
Chess.js: Chess game logic and move validation.

Real-Time Communication:
  Users can join the game and play against each other in real-time using Socket.IO.
Chess Logic:
  The Chess.js library ensures that all moves are valid and adheres to chess rules.
Frontend:
  The application uses EJS templates for dynamic rendering of the game board and UI elements.
