Real-Time Chess Clone
A real-time chess application inspired by Chess.com, built using Express.js, Chess.js, and Socket.IO for real-time gameplay scenarios. The project was created by learning through tutorials and documentation, gaining hands-on experience with server-side data handling and real-time communication.

Features
🎮 Real-time multiplayer chess gameplay.
🕹️ Interactive user interface using EJS templates.
⚡ Fast and efficient real-time updates using Socket.IO.
♟️ Valid chess moves and game logic handled by Chess.js.
📜 Clean and modular code structure for better scalability.
Technologies Used
Languages:

JavaScript, Ejs
Frameworks & Libraries:

Express.js: Backend framework for server handling.
